Data are organized in three folders:

Dataset I    - static   phantom (all data and results are provided with no restrictions).
Dataset II   - digital  phantom (digital phantom data were generated by XCAT software provided by dx.doi.org/10.1118/1.3480985 and https://olv.duke.edu/technologies/4d-extended-cardiac-torso-xcat-phantom-version-2-0/)
Dataset III  - clinical data    (sample data are provided online. The rest of data are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request. Please find that clinical data should are not publicly available for ethical or legal reasons - public availability would compromise patient privacy).


Folders contain the referent geometry, input files/images/DICOMs and obtained geometries with supporting video clips. 
Plase see the paper section 2.9 for the detailed description of data acquisition and purpose.
Please find info/readme files over folders for details related to specific files/folders.
